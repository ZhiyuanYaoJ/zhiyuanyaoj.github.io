# About

I am a research software engineer at [Cisco Meraki](http://meraki.cisco.com). My responsibility consists of:
- Conducting quantitative research based on a vast amount of telemetry data collected from data centers and millions of active networks worldwide.
- Applying cutting-edge algorithms to a wide range of networking problems.
- Deploying models and solutions in real-world distributed systems under various constraints (*e.g.* low latency, high throughput).

I recently completed my PhD degree in Computer Networking, which I pursued jointly between [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)'s [networking team](https://www.epizeuxis.net) and Cisco Systems Paris Innovation and Research Lab (PIRL), advised by [Thomas Clausen](https://www.thomasclausen.net/en/) and [Mark Townsley](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=RSW64hsAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao). My research interests include data-center networks, load-balancing, high-performance networking stacks, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and their applications in computer networking.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a MSc&T in [Internet-of-Things](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/master-all-msct-programs/internet-of-things-innovation-and-management-master/internet-of-things) from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) in 2019, and a BEng in Computational and Applied Methametics from [Harbin Institut of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn) in 2017.
