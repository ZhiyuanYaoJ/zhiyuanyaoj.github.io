# Motivation

Bitrate adaptation is critical to ensure good quality-of- experience (QoE) for Internet video. Several efforts have argued that accurate throughput prediction can dramatically improve the efficiency of:

1. _initial_ bitrate selection to lower startup delay and offer high initial resolution
2. _midstream_ bitrate adaptation for high QoE.

However, prior ef- forts did not systematically quantify real-world throughput predictability or develop good prediction algorithms.

# Contribution

1. Insights from iQiYi dataset w/ 20M+ sessions:
    + Sessions sharing similar key features (e.g., ISP, region) present similar initial throughput values and dynamic patterns;
    + There is a natural “stateful” behavior in throughput variability within a given session.
2. Based on these insights, the authors develop __CS2P__, a throughput prediction system which uses a data-driven approach to learn
    + clusters of similar sessions
    + an initial throughput predictor
    + a Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) based midstream predictor modeling the stateful evolution of throughput

3. Development of a prototype system and show using trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments:
    + CS2P outperforms existing prediction approaches by 40% and 50% in terms of the median prediction error for initial and midstream throughput
    + CS2P achieves 3.2% improvement on overall QoE and 10.9% higher aver- age bitrate over state-of-art Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach [[1]](#ref1), which uses Harmonic Mean for throughput prediction.

# Discussion

## Limitations

1. Proprietary dataset from iQiYi :/
2. Off-line training and online prediction might not be general enough
