# Error

```
$ git pull
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

However I have my ssh publickey on the local machine and has already added it to [GitHub keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).

Then I checked the error logs as is suggested in \[1\]:

```bash
$ ssh -vT git@github.com

Hi ZhiyuanYaoJ! You‘ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Wierd...

# Solution

Luckily I found a solution here \[2\]:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your_git_id/your_repo_name.git
```
