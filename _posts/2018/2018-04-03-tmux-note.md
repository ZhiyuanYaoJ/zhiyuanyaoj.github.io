# Installation
Fortunately installing `tmux` is pretty straightforward on most distributions a simple `sudo apt-get install tmux` (Ubuntu and derivatives) or `brew install tmux` (Mac) should be sufficient.

# Starting the First Session

For the first session, just start with

```bash
$ tmux
```

# Prefix Key

All commands in tmux are triggered by a prefix key followed by a command key (quite similar to emacs). By default, tmux uses `C-b` as prefix key, which simply means press the `Ctrl` and `b` keys at the same time.
