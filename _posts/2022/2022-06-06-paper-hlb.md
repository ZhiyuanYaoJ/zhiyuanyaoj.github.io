title: HLB -- Towards Load-Aware Load Balancing
date: 2022-06-06
description: In the last year of my PhD, I finally managed to push a paper out in the top journal -- IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking! This paper is my first (successful) attempt to apply statistical (or let's use the fancy word -- LEARNING) algorithm to improve load balancing performance in data center networks.

## Intro

I have been working for a couple of years on the subject of making load balancers in data center networks more "intelligent"--in the sense of making appropriate task allocation according to both the dynamic server load states and the static provisioned server capacities.
After accumulating enough results based on both simulation and experiments on physical machines, we are convinced that statistical methods can definitely help load balancers make more informed load balancing decisions and improve resource utilization and quality of service.
We also had the honor to be acknowledged by the top-tier research community and published our work in the [A* ranking journal](http://portal.core.edu.au/jnl-ranks/457/) on networking--[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9787813).


## The Paper: [HLB: Toward Load-Aware Load Balancing](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Heide-Clausen/publication/361079972_HLB_Toward_Load-Aware_Load_Balancing/links/62f625d179550d6d1c764407/HLB-Toward-Load-Aware-Load-Balancing.pdf)

The purpose of network load balancers is to optimize quality of service to the users of a set of servers - basically, to improve response times and to reducing computing resources - by properly distributing workloads. This paper proposes a distributed, application-agnostic, Hybrid Load Balancer (HLB) that - without explicit monitoring or signaling - infers server occupancies and processing speeds, which allows making optimised workload placement decisions. This approach is evaluated both through simulations and extensive experiments, including synthetic workloads and Wikipedia replays on a real-world testbed. Results show significant performance gains, in terms of both response time and system utilisation, when compared to existing load-balancing algorithms.
